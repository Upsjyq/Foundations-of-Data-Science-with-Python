    "**A 40 year-old woman's mammogram comes back positive for a breast cancer tumor. What is the probability that the woman has breast cancer?**\n",

    "One of the most challenging problems for students learning probability is taking a word problem, translating it into mathematics, identifying and finding the necessary information, and solving the problem.  There are several keys to being successful at this. The first two are:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.** Identify all of the phenomena (inputs, outputs, state) that may be random. Note that we should identify phenomenon that may be random **even if we are given a particular outcome, event, or realization occurred for that phenomenon**.\n",
    "**2.** Introduce clearly-defined mathematical terminology for all of the random phenomena in the problem.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem, we use randomness to model our lack of knowledge.  For example, for the woman under consideration, we do not know whether she has breast cancer or not. Thus, whether the woman actually has cancer is one random phenomenon. Although we are told that the mammogram came back positive, in general, it is a random phenomena that will depend on whether the woman being tested has breast cancer. These two are the only random phenomena in this problem, so we can not introduce notation.  Let\n",

    "* $D$ is the event that a mammogram detects breast cancer in a woman in a given year\n",

    "```{note}\n",
    "The next steps in solving a probabiity word problem are:\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.** Translate the probability that is being asked about from words to mathematics.\n",
    "**4.** Use probability techniques to formulate a solution for the problem in terms of probabilities that are known or that can be found from reliable source.\n",
    "```\n",

    "Again, one of the hard things for people learning probability is to even write down a formula for the probability that the problem is asking about.  For instance, this problem states: \"What is the probability that the woman has breast cancer?\"  So, some readers may translate this probability to $$P(C)$$. \n",
    "\n",
    "**That formula is not the probability that this problem is asking about!** The reason is that we need to interpret that sentence in terms of the other information given in the problem. In this case, the first sentence states \"A 40 year-old woman's mammogram comes back positive for a breast cancer tumor\". In other words, we are **given** that the mammogram came back positive for cancer, which in our mathematical notation is $D$.  Thus, the probability that this problem is seeking is $P(C|D)$, which is the *conditional* probability that the woman has cancer *given* that her mammogram detected cancer.\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin to interpret this probability, the reader needs to understand medical tests are never perfect. \n",
    "When a mammogram detects breast cancer, that does *not* necessarily mean that a woman has breast cancer. If a mammogram detects breast cancer and a woman does not actually have breast cancer, that is called a *false alarm*. The probability of a false alarm is $P(\\overline{C}|D)$. You can find information on false alarm rates for mammograms on the Susan G. Komen Foundation's web pages at \n",

    "If a woman does have cancer, a mammogram should detect it most of the time. The probability of detecting an effect given it is actually present is called the *sensitivity* of the test. From the same Susan G. Komen Foundation web page, the sensitivity of a mammograms is $P(D|C)=0.87$. \n",
    "\n",
