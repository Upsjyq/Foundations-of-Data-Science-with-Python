# Introduction to Data Science for Engineers

This is an introductory book on data science for engineers. It is targeted toward those who already have experience with a programming language and need a basic understanding of data visualization, probability, statistics, and linear algebra and their application to generating meaning from data.

The book can be read here: https://jmshea.github.io/intro-data-science-for-engineers/

This book is **very** early in the writing process, but feedback is welcome.
