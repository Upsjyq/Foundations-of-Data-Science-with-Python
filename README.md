# Introduction to Data Science for Engineers (IDSE)

This is an introductory book on data science that is targeted to engineers and readers who already have experience with a programming language.  IDSE teaches the fundamentals of:
* data visualization
* probability
* statistics
* linear algebra
* application of these fundamentals to generate meaning from data.

The book can be read here: https://jmshea.github.io/intro-data-science-for-engineers/

IDSE provides an interactive experience with:
* Interactive self-assessment quizzes via [JupyterQuiz](https://github.com/jmshea/jupyterquiz)
![Animated GIF showing example interactive quiz via JupyterQuiz](quiz-example.gif)
* Interactive flashcards to aid in learning terminology via [JupyterCards](https://github.com/jmshea/jupytercards)

This repository is an experiment with writing in public. I will be putting the book here while it is
still in very early and rough shape. My goals in doing this are to both offer this as a resource to the community
and to get feedback from the community. Your feedback is welcome, but please do understand that this is 
very early and rough, so please be kind!
