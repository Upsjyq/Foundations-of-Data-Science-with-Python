    "One of the most important concepts in probability is *conditional probability*. This is the part of probability that is about determining how different events can affect each other. For data science/statistics, this is particularly important because we are often trying to determine whether an observed effect depends on some underlying feature or analyzing the nature of such dependence. \n"
