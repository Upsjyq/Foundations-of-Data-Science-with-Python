    "# Why learn data science from this book?\n",
    "\n",
    "This book uses a **comptutional first** approach to data science. We take advantage of the power of modern computers to visualize, transform, and simulate data. In particular, we use an approach to statistics in which statistical tests are conducted by carrying out simulations that draw samples from the data being analyzed. This approach has the following benefits:\n",
    "* **We start working with real data sets quickly** because this approach does not require a lot of mathematical background and the computer does all the mathematical manipulation and plotting.\n",
    "* **Simulation models are easy for students to create and understand.** The results do not rely on any arcane formulas but only the ability to build very simple simulations that draw from the experimental data.\n",
    "* **This approach is more general than the traditional approach.** It does not rely on the data coming from specific probability distributions, and the same simulation can be used to generate frequentist or Bayesian statistics. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each chapter of the book provides a review with \"take-aways\" that help summarize the important points from the chapter. These take-aways are targeted to address common questions in interviews for data science jobs."
