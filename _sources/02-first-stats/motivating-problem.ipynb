So, you flip the coin 20 times and count how many times it comes up heads. Since heads and tails are equally likely, you should expect to get somewhere around 10 heads.\n",

    "To determine whether the coin could be fair, we can try to find the probability that a fair coin would produce a result that is as extreme (or more extreme) then what we observed. In other words, if we observe 6 heads, we can determine the probability that a fair coin would produce 6 or fewer heads. If the probability is small, then we can reject the possibility that the coin is fair. How we define \"small\" is up to the experimenter and anyone who reviews their result. For our work, let's say that we will reject the possibility that the coin is fair if the probability that we would see 6 or fewer heads on 20 flips of a fair coin is less than 0.01 (i.e., 1%)."
