    "**Take-aways:**\n",
    "* **Computer simulations can be used to efficiently conduct experiments of random phenomena.**\n",
    "* **Scatter plots are a common visualization tool to see all the values of some numerical data.**\n",
    "* **Histograms are a common visualization tool to see how the values of a numerical data set are distributed.** Unlike scatter plots, the histogram summarizes information about the data: the values of the data cannot be recovered from the histogram.\n",
    "* **Relative frequency of an event is the proportion of experiments where that event occurred.**  For many experiments, if the number of observed experiment outcomes is large, the relative frequency will converge to the true probability of the event.\n",
    "* **Simulations can be used to estimate the probability of some event by measuring the relative frequency.**\n",
    "* **Simulations can be used to determine how likely an observed event has occurred under specific experimental assumptions.**\n",
