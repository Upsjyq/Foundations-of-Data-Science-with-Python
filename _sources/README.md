# Introduction to Data Science for Engineers

This is an introductory book on data science for engineers. It is targeted toward those who already have experience with a programming language and need a basic understanding of data visualization, probability, statistics, and linear algebra and their application to generating meaning from data.

The book can be read here: https://jmshea.github.io/intro-data-science-for-engineers/

This repository is an experiment with writing in public. I will be putting the book here while it is
still in very early and rough shape. My goals in doing this are to both offer this as a resource to the community
and to get feedback from the community. Your feedback is welcome, but please do understand that this is 
very early and rough, so please be kind!
