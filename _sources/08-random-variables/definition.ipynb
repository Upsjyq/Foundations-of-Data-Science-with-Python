    "In the introduction, we provided an informal definition for a random variable. The informal definition is helpful to build some intuition about what we mean by a random variable. However, we want to develop random variables in such a way that we can take advantage of all of the properties of the *probability spaces* that we developed in {doc}`../04-probability1/axiomatic-prob.ipynb`.  In this class, we will only consider the case of **real** random variables, but random variables can also be complex-valued.\n",

    "Let's start by introducing some notation that we will use for  random variables and in our discussion below:\n",
    "* We will generally use upper-case (capital) letters to represent a random variable, such as $X$, $Y$, or $Z$. We may choose the letter to represent a particular quantity, such as representing a random time by $T$ or a random rate by $R$. For a generic random variable, we will usually use $X$. \n",
    "* We want to ask about the probability that a random variable's value lies in some set. Until now, we have used $P$ to denote either a probability or a probability measure. We will draw a distinction between these below, where we will write $\\operatorname{Pr}()$ to denote a probability and $P()$ to denote a particular probability measure.\n",
    "* We will have the need to provide notation for an arbitrary value that a random variable may take on. Such a value will be represented by the lower-case version of the letter used to denote the random variable. In other words, we can ask about the probability that the random variable $X$ takes on a value $x$, which we can write as $\\operatorname{P}(X=x)$. In particular, we can define functions this way; for instance, we can create a function of $x$ that returns $\\operatorname{Pr}(X=x)$ for each real $x$, like $p_X(x) = \\operatorname{Pr}(X=x)$.\n",

    "\n",

    "* Write your random variables in a *san serif* style. Serifs are decorative strokes at the ends of letters, so write your upper-case letters in a block style without serifs.\n",

    "As mentioned above, we wish to be able to evaluate the probabilities that a random variable takes on certain sets of values. There are several immediate problems:\n",
    "* How can we define a random variable so that we can evaluate the probability that it will take on a set of values in  a way that is consistent with our work on probability.\n",
    "* As in the case of event classes and probability measures, it turns out that we cannot come up with a rule that will assign a meaningful probability to any arbitrary set of values that a random variable might take on. How can we choose reasonable sets of values to assign probability to, and how can we evaluate those probabilities?\n",
    "\n",
    "Our approach may seem a bit strange at first, but it defines random variables in a way that directly leverages our work on probability spaces. Suppose we have a probability space $(S, \\mathcal{F}, P)$, and we want to use the probability measure $P$ from this probability space to determine the probabilities for a random variable $X$.  Then if $B$ is a set of real values, we want to translate $\\operatorname{Pr}(X \\in B)$ to some probability $P(E_B)$, where $E_B \\in \\mathcal{F}$ is an event in our probability space. To achieve this, we must have that the outcomes (which do not have to be numbers) in $E_B$ correspond in some way to the real values in $B$. Since we need to be able to determine what outcomes in $E_B$ correspond to the set of reals $B$, then there must be a **function** that maps from the outcomes in $E_B$ to the real values in $B$.  We define the random variable $X$ as that function: it is a function that maps the outcomes in $S$ to the real line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Formally, we do not write a random variable as $X$ but instead write it as $X(s)$ to indicate that it is a function of an outcome in the sample space. Note also that the function itself **is not random**. In other words, if we know that some particular value $s_1 \\in S$ occurred, then $X(s_1)$ is a deterministic real number."

    "Thinking back to our work on probability spaces, you should recall that we cannot define $P(A)$ for all $A \\subset S$ if $S$ is uncountably infinite. We can only define $P(A)$ if $A \\in \\mathcal{F}$. Thus, we will need to introduce some additional restrictions on $X$ to ensure that the sets of values $B$ for which we define the probability $P(X \\in B)$ correspond to events $E_B \\in \\mathcal{F}$.  There is no way to create a random variable that ensures that this will be true for every set of real values $B$, so we must introduce a restriction on the sets $B_i \\subset \\mathbb{R}$ for  which we will define $P(X \\in B_i)$. \n",

If $A$ represents the age of people who have been hospitalized for Covid, we may wish to assess the impact on people outside of the usual working age by  determining the probability that $A$ is less than  18 or greater than or equal to 65.
