    "In **EDIT MODE**, code or Markdown can be typed into a cell. Remember that each cell has a *cell type* associated with it. The cell type does not limit what can be entered into a cell.  The cell type **determines how a cell is evaluated**.  When a cell is evaluated, the contents are parsed by either a Markdown render (for a Markdown cell) or the Python kernel (for a Code cell). Cells may be evaluated in many different ways. Here are a few of the typical ways that we will use:\n",
    "* Most commonly, we will evaluate the current cell by pressing `shift-Enter` on the keyboard. This will always evaluate the current cell. If this is the last cell in the notebook, it will also insert a new cell below the current cell, so that it is easy to continue building the notebook.\n",

    "* Cells can also be run by some of the commands in the `Kernel` menu in the JupyterLab menu. For example, it is always best to reset the Python kernel and run all of the cells in a notebook from top to bottom before sharing a Jupyter notebook with someone else (for example, before submitting an assignment). To do this, click on the `Kernel` menu and choose the `Restart Kernel and Run All Cells...` menu item.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you enter Markdown into a Code cell or Python into a Markdown cell, the results will not be what you intend. For instance, most Markdown is not valid Python, and so if Markdown is entered into a Code cell, a syntax error will be displayed when the cell is evaluted.  Fortunately, you can change the cell type afterward to make it evaluate properly.\n",

When you manually save your work in this way, Jupyter actually saves two copies of your work: it updates the `.ipynb` file that you see in the file list, and it also updates a *hidden* checkpoint file.  When you are updating your document, Jupyter will also autosave your work periodically -- the default is every 120s. When Jupyter autosaves, it only updates the .ipynb file. If Jupyter crashes or your quit it without saving your notebooks, your last autosaved work will be what you see in the .ipynb files.
