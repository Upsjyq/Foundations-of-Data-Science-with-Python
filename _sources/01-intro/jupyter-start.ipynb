    "In **EDIT MODE**, code or Markdown can be typed into a cell. Remember that each cell has a *cell type* associated with it. The cell type does not limit what can be entered into a cell.  The cell type **determines how a cell is evaluated**.  When a cell is evaluated, the contents are parsed by either a Markdown render (for a Markdown cell) or the Python kernel (for a Code cell). Cells may be evaluated in many different ways. Here are a few of the typical ways that we will use:\n",
    "* Most commonly, we will evaluate the current cell by pressing `shift-Enter` on the keyboard. This will always evaluate the current cell. If this is the last cell in the notebook, it will also insert a new cell below the current cell, so that it is easy to continue building the notebook.\n",

    "* Sometimes we wish to make changes in the middle of an existing notebook. To evaluate the current cell and insert a new cell below it, press `alt-Enter` on the computer keyboard.\n",
    "* Cells can also be run by some of the commands in the `Kernel` menu in the JupyterLab menu. For example, it is always best to reset the Python kernel and run all of the cells in a notebook from top to bottom before sharing a Jupyter notebook with someone else (for example, before submitting an assignment). To do this, click on the `Kernel` menu and choose the `Restart Kernel and Run All Cells...` menu item.\n",

    "If you enter Markdown into a Code cell or Python into a Markdown cell, the results will not be what you intend. For instance, most Markdown is not valid Python, and so if Markdown is entered into a Code cell, a syntax error will be displayed when the cell is evaluted.  Fortunately, you can change the cell type afterward to make it evaluate properly.\n",
