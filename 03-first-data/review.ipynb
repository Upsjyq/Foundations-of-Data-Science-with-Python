    "**Key Take-aways:**\n",
    "* Pandas stores data in dataframes. **Dataframes store tabular data, like spreadsheets or database tables.**\n",
    "* **Pandas can import data from standard file formats**, including comma-separated value (CSV) files and Excel files.\n",
    "* **Scatter plots are useful for initial data exploration and identifying outliers.**\n",
    "* **Partitions divide data into disjoint subsets.**\n",
    "* **Summary statistics represent a group of data by a single number.** \n",
    "* **Common summary statistics minimize a measure of error from the summary statistic to the data:**\n",
    "    * Mode minimizes the *error count*.\n",
    "    * Median minimizes the *sum of absolute errors*.\n",
    "    * Average, or sample mean, minimizes the *sum of squared errors*.\n",
    "* A **statistical hypothesis is a hypothesis that is testable using data.**\n",
    "* A **binary hypothesis test is a statistical test that decides between two competing statistical hypotheses.**\n",
    "    * A **null hypothesis, denoted $H_0$ assumes that the data being evaluated come from the same underlying random phenomena**. Observed differences are caused by random sampling.\n",
    "* **Resampling is a model-free technique to draw new samples of data for use in statistical testing.**\n",
    "    * **Bootstrap resampling is when data is drawn from the pooled data with replacement.**\n",
    "* **Two-dimensional statistical methods can be used to directly work with pairs of data** through techniques such as curve fitting."
